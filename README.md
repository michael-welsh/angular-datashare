# Angular Datashare

This project provides the source code for the blog entry on the Cloudaxis website concerning the passing of data between
Angular components. You can find that blog entry [here](https://www.cloudaxis.com/blog-details?id=NvKQjyYGhBoDSHA1a86V)

The code explains four ways that separate components can communicate with one another: 

1. Parent to Child using @Input
2. Child to Parent using Output() and EventEmitter
3. Parent to Child using @ViewChild
4. Unrelated Components using a Global Service.


## Run the examples

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
